This is our database project from our university module "Database Systems" in summer of 2024.

The objective is to create a basic Postgres database by combining 2 datasets using psycopg2 in Python, after which we have to perform some queries and visualizing the results using matplotlib. To achieve this, we had to clean up the data using pandas, design a schema and find out how we can represent the data in a meaningful way.

Authors are Mathias Husted and Maxim Daniel.
